subtitle: Field trials to evaluate N export from perennial groundcover corn systems

Maize (Zea mays L., referred to as corn hereafter) typically grown as a monocrop or
alternating in successive years with soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr), dominates the Midwestern
landscape (Leff, Ramankutty, & Foley, 2004; Glover et al., 2010; USDA, 2019). These crops are only
present on the landscape for a portion of the year, and in their absence cannot intercept and protect soil
from rainfall, particularly if stover is removed after harvest (Wilhelm et al., 2004), nor can they slow
runoff and promote infiltration (Bharati, Lee, Isenhart, & Schultz, 2002). Furthermore, lacking growing
plants to immobilize nitrogen (N), N is exported through leaching and runoff (David et al., 2010). Moore
et al. (2019) developed a perennial groundcover (PGC) system for corn in which a summer-dormant
perennial groundcover (e.g., fescue) provides year-round soil cover, while the corn can be cultivated
because of the temporal complementarity. In contrast to relay cover cropping, a PGC approach does not
require significant late and early-season field activities, both of which are cost and complexity barriers to
wider adoption of relay-cover systems (Dunn et al., 2016; Gonzalez-Ramirez et al., 2017; Plastina et al.,
2018).
