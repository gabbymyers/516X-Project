Soil moisture content refers to the moisture in the soil. We determine this by collecting a sample from each of our 36 plots at the Northeast Iowa Research Farm. The sample is taken back to the lab and the moisture content is determined by weighing the soil before and after drying. Soil samples were collected roughly every 2 weeks to get 12 soil samples for each plot. 

## Research Question     

Does treatment have an effect on the soil moisture content?     

More specifically, does the PGC system have the same, higher, or lower soil moisture content than our other treatments?

**Sample code**

~~~
trt_means = pd.DataFrame(soil_moisture.groupby('Treatment')['MC'].describe()['mean'])
trt_means = trt_means.reset_index()
trt_means['mean'] = 100 * trt_means['mean']

ax = sns.barplot(x = 'Treatment', y = 'mean', data = trt_means)
ax.set_title('2021 Mean Soil Moisture Content')
ax.set(xlabel='Treatment', ylabel='Mean MC %')

#for annotating 
for p in ax.patches:
             ax.annotate("%.1f" % p.get_height(), (p.get_x() + p.get_width() / 2., p.get_height()),
                 ha='center', va='center', fontsize=10, color='black', xytext=(0, 5),
                 textcoords='offset points')
        
plt.savefig('MC_bar_trt.jpg', bbox_inches='tight')
~~~

**Code**

~~~
ax = sns.boxplot(x = "Treatment", y = "MC", data = soil_moisture, hue = 'Short Trt Description', dodge = False)
plt.legend(bbox_to_anchor=(1.05, 1), loc=2, borderaxespad=0.)
plt.savefig('trt_mc_box.jpg', bbox_inches='tight')

ax = sns.boxplot(x = "Date", y = "MC", data = soil_moisture)
plt.savefig('date_bc_box.jpg', bbox_inches='tight')
~~~

I wrote a function to make box plots for each date, but won't incldude them on this post. You can see them in the jupyter notebook here: [Link](https://github.com/gabbymyers/516X-Project/blob/master/_data/Soil%20Moisture%20Analysis.ipynb)

~~~
def filterbydate (sampledate):
    sample_date_df = pd.DataFrame(soil_moisture[soil_moisture.Date == sampledate])
    return sample_date_df

sample_date = 1 
while sample_date <= max(soil_moisture.Date):
    date_df = filterbydate(sample_date)
    date_df.boxplot('MC', by = 'Treatment')
    plt.title('Moisture Content by Trt on Date {}'.format(sample_date))
    plt.suptitle("")
    plt.ylabel("Moisture Content, DB")
    sample_date = sample_date + 1
~~~

### ANOVA

Seeing if block, sample date, or treatment had a significant effect on soil moisture content. I have a feeling that date will have a significant effect because the soil moisture content is very dependent on the weather of the days surrounding when we got the sample. I hope to see that block did not have an effect. I'm not sure what we will see from treatment, but some people believe that cover crop would make the soil drier because they are using any excess moisture. 

Because we measured soil moisture multiple times throughout the season on the same plots, this is a time to use repeated measures anova. 

**Checking for normality**
~~~
sns.kdeplot(data=soil_moisture, x="MC")
plt.title('Soil Moisture Kernel Density Plot')
plt.savefig('soil_moisture_kde.jpg', bbox_inches='tight')

import scipy.stats as stats
stats.probplot(soil_moisture['MC'], dist="norm", plot=plt)
plt.show()
plt.savefig('soil_moisture_probplot', bbox_inches='tight')

~~~

The data as a whole looks mostly normal, but I need to check for normality within my groups. I found a package called pingouin ([Documentation](https://pingouin-stats.org/api.html)) that has a easy function to check for normality. 

~~~
pip install pingouin
import pingouin as pg
pg.normality(soil_moisture, group='Treatment', dv='MC')
pg.normality(soil_moisture, group='Date', dv='MC')
pg.normality(soil_moisture, group='Block', dv='MC')
~~~

**Treatment**

**Date**

**Block**

Not all groups are normally distributed. 

**Bartlettâ€™s Test of Homogeneity of Variances**

Using a function in pingouin to do the test for date, block, and treatment. 

![Bartletts Test Moisture Content](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gabbymyers/516X-Project/master/assets/img/bartletts_mc.JPG)

The date variable does not have equal variances. 

I attempted to use a repeated measures ANOVA function in python:
~~~
from statsmodels.stats.anova import AnovaRM
~~~

I did not have luck using AnovaRM, so I used the mixed procedure in SAS to evaluate the effects. The most powerful covariance structure for the model I found was the hetereogenous compound symmetry (csh in SAS) structure. It had the lowest AIC and BIC values for the models I considered.  

~~~
proc mixed data=A IC;
class Block Trt Date;
  model MC = Block Trt Date Trt*Date /ddfm =satterth;
  repeated Date / subject=Trt*Block type=csh r rcorr;
ods output infocrit=csh;
run;
~~~

These results tell me that treatment, date, and the interaction between treatment and date ae significant.
